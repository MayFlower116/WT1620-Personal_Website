    <!-- Create an empty folder and name it “personal_website” and initialize a git repository in it.
        Create a new file “index.html” in that folder. Add the following items in it:
            Two headings (Use appropriate heading tags)
            A paragraph about you, with one use of <em> and one use of <strong> tag
                The <strong> tag should be used to indicate strong importance, seriousness, or urgency, like to indicate key phrases in a text for someone skimming it. The <em> tag should be used to represent stress emphasis, like when you'd read the emphasized text in a different tone of voice. Both tags can be used together, where it makes sense.
            A list of 3 of the courses you are taking (use appropriate list tag)
                One of the items on the list must be hyper-linked to the course outline of that course (use absolute URL)
        Use git add and git commit commands to make sure your repository has the latest version of your code.
        Run "git log --stat", take a screenshot of the output (it should show your commits and the files changed in each commit)
        Submit a zip file containing your folder and the screenshot.-->
