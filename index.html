            <h1>Elijah's Personal Site</h1>
        </header>

        <p><strong>Hello, I'm Elijah</strong>- maybe, not sure, I'll get back to you on that. Welcome to my 3rd ever
            personal site, the 2nd one using html and the 1st one using visual studio to put it together. <strong>I'm a
                nerd</strong> who's obsessed with <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, I enjoy reading and playing games, and
            my favourite comic is <em>Rain</em> by <i>Jocelyn Samara</i>. I enjoy <strong>programming and game
                design</strong>, and I'm currently <strong>attending BCIT</strong> to pursue work in the video game
            industry, along with blah blah blah, this isn't a cover letter. Don't ask me why this was made when it was.
            I once worked at a thrift store, got a job since the store was closing and they needed help getting
            everything out and such. It was fun, and since they couldn't afford minimum wage, I got to take home a but
            of garbage for free- I still have an entire box of paper rolls, and several hard stone slates. Oh yeah, I
            also like art, as well as things and stuff. Dresses are awesome, fight me.</p>
